# Task Completion Checklist

## After Making Code Changes

1. **Lint and Format**

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

   This runs both ESLint and Prettier to ensure code quality and consistent formatting.

2. **Build**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript and validates the configuration.

3. **Preview Changes (REQUIRED before pushing)**

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

   Shows what DNS changes will be applied without actually making them.
   Review the diff carefully to ensure no unintended changes.

4. **Apply Changes (Only if preview looks correct)**
   ```bash
   npm run push
   ```
   **WARNING**: This applies changes to LIVE DNS infrastructure.

## Testing

- **No automated tests** exist in this repository
- Validation is done via `npm run preview` to see the diff
- Manual verification of DNS records after push

## Important Notes

- Always run `preview` before `push`
- DNS changes can take time to propagate (TTL is set to 1 for fast updates)
- Credentials in `src/creds.json` are required but NOT in git (must be created manually)
- Use `IGNORE_NAME()` for records managed outside this system (DDNS, Cloudflare UI)
- DNSControl binaries are downloaded automatically during `npm install`
- Binaries are gitignored but download script is tracked
- Output directory `out/` is gitignored (generated by webpack)

## Credentials Setup

The `src/creds.json` file must contain Cloudflare API credentials:
```json
{
  "cloudflare": {
    "apitoken": "your-cloudflare-api-token"
  }
}
```

This file is copied to `out/creds.json` during build by webpack.
